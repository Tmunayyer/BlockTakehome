# Block Rennovation Takehome

Submission by Thomas Munayyer.

Enclosed you will find the toy problem challenge as well as the architecture assignment.

## The Toy Problem

The toy problem contians the solution as well as a super sparse testing and assertion setup. You will find the naive approach and an optimized approach in sortBy/sortBy.js.

To run the tests and have node installed: 

from the root of this repo run:

```
node run sortBy/test.js
```

## Architecture Assignment

The architecture assignment is entirely in /architecture/README.md. I found markdown was the best way to organize the assignment and easiest way to integrate code snippets and JSON examples.
